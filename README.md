Description: A simple Java program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

1. User Input: Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. Operation Selection: Asks the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. Operation Performance: Performs the selected operation on the input numbers.
4. Result Display: Displays the result of the operation to the user.
5. Error Handling: Handles division by zero and invalid operation choices.

Program Structure:

1. Import necessary libraries (java.util.Scanner)
2. Define the main class (Calculator)
3. Create a Scanner object to read user input
4. Prompt user to enter two numbers and store them in variables (num1, num2)
5. Display operation choices and prompt user to select one
6. Use a switch statement to perform the selected operation
7. Display the result of the operation
8. Handle errors (division by zero, invalid choice)

Variables:

- num1: first input number
- num2: second input number
- choice: user's operation choice
- result: result of the operation

Methods:

- main(): the program's entry point

Output:

- Prompts and messages to guide the user
- Result of the operation

This program provides a basic calculator functionality, allowing users to perform simple arithmetic operations. It can be extended to include more advanced features like handling multiple operations, using functions, or implementing a graphical user interface.
